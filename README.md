# Supercell-jailbreak

I didn't think I would have to mention it but recently all my dms has been about those `.ipas` being a mod/hack so to make things clear:

## THIS IS NOT A HACK OR A MOD and I DO NOT support development of exploits in Supercell games. This is just a simple patch to allow people on jailbroken IDevices to play Supercell games

## Notes: ##

I always try to update as fast as possible when an update is required

If you encounter a crash during playing, startup or whenever, open an issue or contact me with the crash logs, i will try to resolve the issue.


## Download ##

Since the main executable has been modified to apply the patches, the IPA needs to be resign by a tool like [Sideloadly](https://sideloadly.io/) or If your iOS supports [TrollStore](https://github.com/opa334/TrollStore) you can also use that, therefore installing with filza can cause the game to crash.

## FAQ ##

####  Why do you make it in form of an `.ipa` and not a `deb` tweak? ####
At this moment, i don't have enough information about the jailbreak detection to make a working `deb` tweak to patch the jailbreak detection

#### Is there a chance of getting banned from this? #### 
While I have never been banned from using modded `.ipas` which I do for 2 years already, other popular mods on android got massive player ban so I can only say USE THIS AT YOUR OWN RISK, i am not responsible if your account is getting banned. But hey, if you arrived here, it's because you couldn't play anyway right ;)

#### Why are in app purchases blocked ? ####
Any repackaged `.ipa` and the same applies for Android with repackaged `apks`, they has not been officially installed from the store and in app purchases are disabled. Hopefully with Supercell there is a workaround and it's to use their store here [https://store.supercell.com/](https://store.supercell.com/) to make purchases to your account (and it have a better value than the real game purchase)

#### The app doesn't work on Mac? ####
Supercell does not officially supports playing on MacOS computers, while some people have told me they managed to play on their Mac, It is possible that some of these `ipas` just doesn't work on MacOS and there's nothing i can do.

#### Bugs in the game: ####
I am not Supercell developer nor a game developer, i don't modify anything in the executable that can cause a crash/bug in the middle of the game, the protection I remove is only being done during the black screen state of the game. Therefore, i can't fix bugs that happens in the game, that's to Supercell to fix them.

### Enjoy being able to play again supercell games! ###
